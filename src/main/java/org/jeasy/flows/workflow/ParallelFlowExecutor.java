   * so the user shuts it down himself 2. If the user provides a custom executor which is shared by
   * multiple parallel flow, shutting it down here (as currently done) may impact other flows 3. If
   * it is decided to shut down the executor at the end of the parallel flow, the parallel flow
   * could not be re-run (in a repeat flow for example) since the executor will be in an illegal
